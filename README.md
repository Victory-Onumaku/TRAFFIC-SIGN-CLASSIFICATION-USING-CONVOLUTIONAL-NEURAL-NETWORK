# TRAFFIC-SIGN-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK

(![—Pngtree—set of road signs collection_8665817](https://github.com/Victory-Onumaku/TRAFFIC-SIGN-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK/assets/91481737/1818f260-c693-4751-bcf6-6c95137154f6)

In this project, we used a convolutional neural network to build train, and test a traffic sign classification model. We built this model using tensorflow and keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. This model can be used to make smarter cars. <br>
After this project, one can be able to build multiclass classification model using deep learning.
