(![—Pngtree—set of road signs collection_8665817](https://github.com/Victory-Onumaku/TRAFFIC-SIGN-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK/assets/91481737/1818f260-c693-4751-bcf6-6c95137154f6)

In this project, we used a convolutional neural network to build train, and test a traffic sign classification model. We built this model using tensorflow and keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. This model can be used to make smarter cars. <br>
After this project, one can be able to build multiclass classification model using deep learning.

# STEPS TAKEN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS <br>
1) Finding data on kaggle and loading it into google colab <br>

2) Preprocessing the image and visualizing them <br>

3) Finding out the mean of the dimension and resizing all images accordingly <br>

4) Converting the images into a numpy array and normalize them <br>

5) Checking class imbalance <br>

6) Splitting the data and performing one hot encoding <br>

7) Creating the model architecture, compliling the model and then fitting it <br>

8) Plotting the accuracy and loss against each Epoch <br>

9) Preprocessing the test data and make predictions on it <br>

10) Visualize the original and predicted labels for the test images.
